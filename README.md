# Law School Debt Calculator

This repository contains all of the code for [lsdebt.com](https://lsdebt.com), a website to help future law students (or those just considering law school) **quickly and easily estimate law school costs**. 

## The Site

[lsdebt.com](https://lsdebt.com) is built with [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/), a framework for building dashboards. 

It's currently deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 

## Running Locally

Working on it. I swear. 

I'm migrating everything to Docker for reproducibility. 

## About the Data

Currently, data comes from two places: 

- [ABA Required Disclosures](https://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/Disclosure509.aspx) - Data from reports from law schools mandated by the American Bar Association to maintain accreditation. Includes all of the costs and expenses for attending law schools. 
- [publiclegal](https://www.ilrg.com/rankings/law/median/1/desc/MSPrivate) website - Law school median salaries for public and private sectors. 

## About the Project

Funnily enough, I am not (nor do I ever plan to be) a law student! I built this project to help my girlfriend as she went through the law school process, so that she could easily compare the costs of various law schools, including scholarships and cost of living. 

I thought maybe it could be of some use to other law students, so left the website up. Suggestions and improvement ideas more than welcome! Feel free to make an Issue right here in this repo.
